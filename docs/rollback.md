Rollback in this project is designed to be safe, fast, and controlled, without introducing additional complexity or automation risks. Instead of relying on automatic rollbacks, the system follows a manual rollback approach, which is commonly used in production environments where stability and data safety are more important than speed alone. Here I have used the ECS, So there was auto-roll back enabled Hence when the task deployent faild or any issue occured, it will auto rollback

If you want to achieve application rollback is achieved by redeploying a previously known stable Docker image version from Amazon ECR. Since all images are tagged and retained in the repository, any earlier version can be redeployed at any time. The CD workflow accepts the image tag as an input parameter, allowing operators to choose exactly which version should be deployed. When a rollback is required, the user simply triggers the deployment pipeline again and provides the image tag of the last stable release.

During deployment or rollback, a new ECS task definition revision is registered with the selected image version. The ECS service is then updated to use this new task definition and a forced deployment is triggered. ECS handles the rollout safely by gradually replacing running tasks while keeping the service available. Once the service reaches a stable state, the rollback is considered complete.

Database changes are intentionally excluded from automatic rollback. Schema migrations are executed separately and only when explicitly triggered. This avoids the risk of rolling back database changes that may already be in use or contain production data. Any database rollback, if required, would be handled manually using backups or targeted SQL scripts, which is a standard and recommended practice in real-world systems.
